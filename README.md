# RAG-Chatbot-Customer-Service-agent
This project implements a customer support agent that answers queries related to e-commerce  products and policies. It utilizes a combination of a vector database (Chroma) for efficient  retrieval of relevant information and a language model (FLAN-T5) for generating responses. 

This project successfully builds a customer support agent that retrieves relevant information and provides intelligent responses using a combination of retrieval-based and generative AI approaches. It serves as a foundational framework that can be improved and expanded for more advanced customer support functionalities. 

Below I have screenshots of a few instances from experimenting with my chatbot.
